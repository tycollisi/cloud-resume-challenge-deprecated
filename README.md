# cloud-resume-challenge
This repository contains my submission for the Cloud Resume Challenge. The challenge involves creating a static website that showcases my resume and deploying it to the cloud using AWS.
## Files
The `resume-site` folder contains the files used to design the resume website:

- `index.html`: This file contains the HTML code for the resume website.
- `resume.css`: This file contains the CSS code for styling the resume website.

The `template.yaml` file is the infrastructure as code used in AWS SAM / CloudFormation to deploy the resume site in AWS.
